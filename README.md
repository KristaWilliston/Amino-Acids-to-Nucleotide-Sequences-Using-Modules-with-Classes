# Amino-Acids-to-Nucleotide-Sequences-Using-Modules-with-Classes

The output is a string of amino acids corresponding to a nucleotide sequence.  The result is running the ModuleForCodonTables.py file along with the standard.code file along with the seq.txt file.

I used the complete DNASeq.py module. I used the outline of the codon_table module.  To the codon_table.py module, I added self where necessary to get the program to work properly.
